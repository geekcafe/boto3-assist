This license is permissive, meaning it allows almost unrestricted use of the code, 
including the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, 
and/or sell copies of the software. 

However, it requires that the original copyright notice and permission notice be included 
in all copies or substantial portions of the software, ensuring I get credit for my work.

Hey, this took a lot of work, so I'd like to get some recognition for it if you use it. ðŸ˜‰

Thanks for your understanding and support.  I hope this library is of use to you!
